# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Implementing Machine Learning Algorithm in Python on Titanic Dataset

# Dataset Overview
The data has been split into two groups:

1. Training set (train.csv)  
2. Test set (test.csv)  

The training set is used to build the machine learning models. Our model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. 

The test set should be used to see how well our model performs on unseen data. For the test set, the ground truth (Survived) for each passenger is not provided. It is our job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, we use the trained model to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
