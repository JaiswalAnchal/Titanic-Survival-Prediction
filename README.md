# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Implementing Machine Learning Algorithm in Python on Titanic Dataset


Goal of the Project
The goal is to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. 
For each PassengerId in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived variable.
